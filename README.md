# unit-4-game-

Execute this application and and your first game has started!!  You will be presented with
instructions how to play the game on the screen and from there, it's all up to you.

This application is intended to provide hours of fun to the user - if you think a 
bit of math and memory exercising is "fun".

The application is built using basic html, css, and javascript.

This game is not currently licensed, so enjoy whilst you can.

If you'd like to contact the developer of this application please direct your questions to
Ken Riley through the University of Texas system Coding Bootcamp from the second portion of
the 2019 spring session.

Thanks and enjoy!!
Ken
